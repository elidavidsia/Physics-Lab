## Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

Projectile motion is a key concept in physics, offering valuable insights into the fundamental laws of motion. By investigating how the range of a projectile changes with its angle of projection, we delve into both simple and complex relationships, characterized by linear and quadratic equations. These equations allow us to explore the influence of variables such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height. Understanding the dynamics of projectile motion opens up numerous real-world applications, from the arc of a soccer ball to the trajectory of a rocket.

This investigation not only provides a theoretical foundation but also extends to practical applications. By simulating projectile motion under various initial conditions, we can visualize the relationship between the angle of projection and the range. The task encourages a deeper understanding of how different parameters—such as velocity and gravity—affect motion, while also highlighting the limitations of idealized models. Incorporating more realistic factors, like air resistance, offers opportunities for further exploration in fields ranging from engineering to astrophysics.

### 1. Theoretical Foundation
Projectile motion is governed by the following key equations, assuming no air resistance and that the only force acting on the projectile is gravity:

<br>

### Equations of Motion:

#### <center>In the horizontal direction:</center>
$$ x(t) = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot t $$

#### <center>In the vertical direction:</center>
$$ y(t) = v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

<br>
##### Where:
<p>$x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are the horizontal and vertical positions of the projectile at time $t$.
$v_0$ is the initial velocity.
$θ$ is the angle of projection.
$g$ is the gravitational acceleration.
