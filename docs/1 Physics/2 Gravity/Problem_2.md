# Problem 2

## Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

The study of velocities in celestial mechanics is fundamental to understanding how spacecraft can break free from a planet’s gravitational pull, enter orbit, or leave the solar system. These velocities are typically categorized as escape velocities and cosmic velocities. The escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from a planet’s gravitational field, while cosmic velocities define the different thresholds for orbital and interstellar escape.

#### Types of Cosmic Velocities

- First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital velocity)
- Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape velocity)
- Third Cosmic Velocity (Escape velocity from the Solar System)

## 1. Definitions and Physical Meaning

### Escape Velocity

The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body, such as Earth, without further propulsion. This velocity depends on the mass and radius of the body from which the object is escaping. The formula for escape velocity is:

$$
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

Where:

- **G** = gravitational constant $6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$
- **M** = mass of the celestial body (kg)
- **R** = radius of the celestial body (m)

### First Cosmic Velocity

The first cosmic velocity is the speed an object must have to remain in a stable circular orbit around a celestial body. This is the orbital velocity:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

### Second Cosmic Velocity

The second cosmic velocity, or escape velocity, is the speed needed to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body entirely, without falling back to it. As mentioned above, this is given by the same formula:

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

### Third Cosmic Velocity

The third cosmic velocity is the escape velocity required to escape the Sun’s gravitational influence and leave the Solar System entirely:

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\text{sun}}}{R_{\text{sun}}} + \frac{2GM_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{planet}}}}
$$

## 2. Mathematical Derivations

We start by considering the energy required to escape a celestial body. The total mechanical energy $E$ of an object in a gravitational field is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and gravitational potential energy $U$.

**Gravitational Potential Energy:**

$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{R}
$$

For escape, we need the total energy to be zero (the object should just reach infinity with zero speed). Therefore:

$$
\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{R}
$$

Solving for escape velocity:

$$
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

## 3. Analysis and Calculation

Now, let's calculate and visualize the first, second, and third cosmic velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.


### Parameters

**Earth:**  
Mass of Earth ($M_{\text{Earth}}$) = $5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg  
Radius of Earth ($R_{\text{Earth}}$) = $6.371 \times 10^6$ m


**Mars:**  
Mass of Mars ($M_{\text{Mars}}$) = $6.417 \times 10^{23}$ kg  
Radius of Mars ($R_{\text{Mars}}$) = $3.396 \times 10^6$ m


**Jupiter:**  
Mass of Jupiter ($M_{\text{Jupiter}}$) = $1.898 \times 10^{27}$ kg  
Radius of Jupiter ($R_{\text{Jupiter}}$) = $6.991 \times 10^7$ m


**Sun:**  
Mass of Sun ($M_{\text{Sun}}$) = $1.989 \times 10^{30}$ kg


**Distance from Earth to Sun:**  
$R_{\text{Earth-Sun}}$ = $1.496 \times 10^{11}$ m

### Visualization and Calculation

Using the given parameters, we can now calculate the escape velocities, orbital velocities, and third cosmic velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. The calculations depend on the mass and radius of each celestial body, and for the third cosmic velocity, the gravitational influences of both the planet and the Sun are considered.
