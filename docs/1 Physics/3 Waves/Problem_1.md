## Interference Patterns On A Water Surface
Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.

Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics.

## 1. Theory and Mathematical Formulation
When a point source generates ripples on a water surface, it emits a circular wave that propagates outward from the source. At any location on the water surface, the vertical displacement (height) of the water due to this wave at a given time can be described by a mathematical wave function.

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at $(x_0, y_0)$, can be described by the Single Disturbance equation:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos\left(kr - \omega t + \phi\right)
$$
 
##### Where:

- **$\eta(\vec{r}, t)$** is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$
- **$A$** is the amplitude of the wave
- **$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$** is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$
- **$\omega = 2\pi f$** is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$
- **$r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$** is the distance from the source to the point $(x, y)$
- **$\phi$** is the initial phase

#### Explanation of Terms:

**Wave Displacement: $\eta(\vec{r}, t)$** â€” how much the water surface moves up or down at position $(x, y)$ and time $t$  

**Amplitude: $A$** â€” how high the wave gets (the maximum height from the center level)  

**Wave Number: $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$** â€” tells us how tightly packed the waves are (how many waves fit in a certain distance), where $\lambda$ is the wavelength (distance between peaks)  

**Angular Frequency: $\omega = 2\pi f$** â€” tells us how quickly the wave goes up and down, where $f$ is the frequency (how many wave cycles happen per second)  

**Distance from Source: $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$** â€” the straight-line distance from the wave source at point $(x_0, y_0)$ to the point $(x, y)$  

**Initial Phase: $\phi$** â€” tells us where in its cycle the wave starts at time $t = 0$
