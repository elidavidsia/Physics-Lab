## Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

The Lorentz force governs the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. It plays a crucial role in systems such as particle accelerators, mass spectrometers, and plasma confinement. This task involves exploring the theoretical and practical implications of the Lorentz force through simulations that visualize the complex trajectories of charged particles under different field configurations.

## 1. Exploration of Applications

The Lorentz force is central to numerous scientific and engineering applications. In particle accelerators, it helps control the motion of particles, bending their trajectories with magnetic fields and accelerating them with electric fields. In mass spectrometers, it separates charged particles based on their mass-to-charge ratio. In fusion reactors, magnetic fields are used to confine plasma, aiding in controlled nuclear fusion.

The electric field accelerates particles, while the magnetic field bends their trajectories, often resulting in circular or helical motion. The interaction between these fields allows for precise control over the movement of charged particles.

## 2. Theory and Mathematical Formulation

The Lorentz force is given by:

<center><strong>Lorentz Force Equation:</strong></center>

$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

Where:

- **$\vec{F}$**: Force acting on the particle  
- **$q$**: Charge of the particle  
- **$\vec{E}$**: Electric field  
- **$\vec{v}$**: Velocity of the particle  
- **$\vec{B}$**: Magnetic field  

The motion of the charged particle is governed by this equation, where the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field, resulting in circular or helical motion depending on the field configuration.

## 4. Parameter Exploration

In this simulation, you can vary several parameters:

- **$B$**: Magnetic field strength  
- **$E$**: Electric field strength  
- **$v_0$**: Initial particle velocity  
- **$q$, $m$**: Charge and mass of the particle

Observe how these parameters influence the trajectory of the particle, including circular motion, helical motion, and drift velocity in crossed fields.
